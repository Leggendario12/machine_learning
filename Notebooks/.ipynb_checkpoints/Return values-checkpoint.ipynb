    "# Return values\n",
    "\n",
    "Return values of functions are one of those things where Python is light years ahead of most other languages. Functions are usually allowed to return one object (one value) but, in Python, you can return a tuple, and this implies that you can return whatever you want. This feature allows a code to write software that would be much harder to write in any other language, or certainly more tedious. We've already said that to return something from a function we need to use the __return__ statement, followed by what we want to return. There can be as many return statements as needed in the body of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if within the body of a function we don't return anything, the function will return __None__. This behavior is harmless and, even though I don't have the room here to go to into detail explaining why Python was designed like this, let me just tell you that this feature allows for several interesting patterns, and confirms Python as a very consistent language.\n",
    "\n",
    "I say it's harmless because you are never forced to collect the result of a function call. I'll show you what I mean with an example:"

    "Note that the whole body of the function is comprised only of the __pass__ statement. As the official documentation tells us, __pass__ is a null operation. When it is executed, nothing happens. It is useful as a placeholder when a statement is required syntactically, but no code needs to be executed. In other languages, we would probably just indicate that with a pair of curly braces (__{}__), which define an *empty scope* but in Python a scope is defined by indenting one, therefore a statement such as __pass__ is necessary.\n",

This feature opens up a whole world of possibilities and allows you to code in a style that is hard to reproduce with other languages. Our thinking is limited by the tools we use, therefore when Python gives you more freedom than other languages, it is actually boosting your own creativity as well. To return multiple values is very easy, you just use tuples (either explicitly or implicitly). Let's look at a simple example that mimics the divmod built-in function:\n"
