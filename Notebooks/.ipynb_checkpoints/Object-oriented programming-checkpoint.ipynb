There are different and better ways to do this, but I want to keep this example as simple as possible.\n",

Finally, we create the **RegularHexagon** and **Square** classes, which both inherit from **RegularPolygon**.\n",

This is because they both provide the correct implementation logic for it. Also, I can call **get_geometric_type** on both of them, even though it is not defined on their classes, and Python has to go all the way up to **Shape** class, the **self.geometric_type** used for the return value is correctly taken from the caller instance.\n",

This technique is very popular in web frameworks such as Django (which we'll explore in two later chapters), which provides speciall classes called **mixins**, who capabilities you can just use out of the box. All you have to do is to define the desired mixin as one the base classes your own, and that's it.\n",

This is quite simple to understand if the inheritance chain is only comprised of single inheritance steps, which means that classes have only one parent.

First we remove all characters from **s** that are not either letters or numbers. In order to do this, we use the **join** method of a string object (an empty string object, in this case). By calling **join** on an empty string, the result is that all elements in the iterable you to **join** will be concatenated together. We feed **join** a generator expression that says, *take any character from s if the character is either alphanumeric or a number*. I hope you have been able to find that out by yourself, maybe using the inside-out technique I showed you in one of the preceding chapters.\n",

In order to do this, we compare the first and last characters, then the second and the second to last, and so on. If at any point we find a difference, it means the string isn't a palindrome and therefore we can return **False**. On the other hand, if we exit the **for** loop normally, it means no differences were found, and we can therefore say the string is a palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this code works correctly regardless of the length of the string, that is, if the length is odd or even. **len(s) // 2** reaches half of **s**, and if **s** is an odd amount of characters long, the middle won't be checked (like in *RaDaR*, *D* is not checked), but we don't care; it would be compared with itself so it's always passing that check.\n",

A very common use ase for private attributes are helper methods that are supposed to be used by public ones (possibly in call chains in conjunction with other methods), and internal data, like scaling factors, or any other data that ideally we would put in a constant (a variable that cannot change, but, surprise, surprise, Python doesn't have those either).\n",

Imagine that you have an **age** attribute in a **Person** class and at some point you want to make sure that when you change its value, you're also checking that **age** is within a proper range, like [18, 99]. You can write accessor methods, like **get_age()** and **set_age()** (also called **getters** and **setters**) and put the logic there. **get_age()** will most likely just return **age**, while **set_age()** will also do the range check. The problem is that you may already have a lot of code accessing the **age** attribute directly, which means you're now up to some good (and potentially dangerous and tedious) refactoring. Languages like Java overcome this problem by using accessor pattern basically by default. Many Java **Integrated Development Environments (IDES)** autocomplete an attribute declaration by writing getter and setter accessor methods stubs for you on the fly.\n",

In Python, we rewrite **Person** as **PersonPythonic** (you normally wouldn't change the name, of course) so that the age is stored in a private **__age** variable, and we define property getters and setters using that decoration, which allow us to keep using the **person** instances as we were before. A **getter** is a method that is called when we access an attribute for reading. On the other hand, a **setter** is a method that is called when we access an attribute to write it. In other languages, like Java for example, it's customary to define them as **get_age()** and **set_age(int value)**, but I find the Python syntax much neater.
