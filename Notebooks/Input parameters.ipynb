Take a look at the **Frames** column, and note tha we have two name, **x** and **func**, in the global namespace (**Global frame**), pointing to an **int** (with a value of three) and to a function object, respectively. Right below it, in the rectangle titled **func**, we can see the function's local namespace, in which only one name has been defined: **y**. Because we have called **func** with **x** (line 5 in the left part of the picture), **y** is pointing to the same object that **x** is pointing to. This is what happens under the hood when an argument is passed to a function. If we had used the name **x** insterad of **y** in the function definition, things would have been exactly the same (only maybe a bit confusing at first), there would be a local **x** in the function, and a global **x** outside, as we saw in the *Scopes and name resolution* section.\n",
