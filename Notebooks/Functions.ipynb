    "# A few useful tips\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing functions, it's very useful to follow guidelines so that you write them well. I'll quickly point some of them out here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Function should do one thing:__ Functions that do one thing are easy to describe in one short sentence. Functions which do multiple things can split into smaller functions which do one thing. These smaller functions are usually easier to read and understand. Remember the data science example we saw a few pages ago.\n",
    "* __Functions should be small:__ The smaller they are, the easier it is to test them and to write them so that they do one thing.\n",
    "* __The fewer input parameters, the better:__ Functions which take a lot of arguments quickly become harder to manage (among other issues).\n",
    "* __Functions should be consistent in their return values:__ Returning False or None is not the same thing, even if within a Boolean context they both evaluate to **False. False** means that we have information (__False__), while **None** means that there is no information. Try writing functions which return in a consistent way, no matter what happens in their body.\n",
    "* __Functions shouldn't have side effects:__ In other words, functions should not affect the values you call them with. This is probably the hardest statement to understand at this point, so I'll give you an example using lists. In the following code, note how **numbers** is not sorted by the __sorted__ function, which actually return a sorted copy of **numbers**. Conversely, the __list.sort()__ method is acting on the  **numbers** object itself, and that is fine because it is a method (a function that belongs to an object and therefore has the rights to modify it):\n",

    "# Recursive functions\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function calls itself to produce a result, it is said to be __recursive__. Sometimes recursive functions are very useful in that the make it easier to write code. Some algorithms are very easy to write using the recursive paradigm, while others are not. There is no recursive function that cannot be writted in an iterative fashio, so it's usually up to the programmer to choose the best approach for the case at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recursive function usually has a set of base cases for which the return value doesn't depend on a subsequent call to the function itself and a set of recursive cases, for which the return value is calculated with one or more calls to the function itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we can consider the (hopefully familiar by now) __factorial__ function *N!*. The base case is when *N* is either 0 or 1. The function returns 1 with no need for further calculation. On the other hand, in the general case, _N!_ returns the product *1 * 2 * ... * (N-1) * N*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think about it, _N!_ can be writted like this: _N! =(N-1)! * N_. As a practical example, consider *5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = (1 * 2 * 3 * 4) * 5 = 4! * 5*.\n",
